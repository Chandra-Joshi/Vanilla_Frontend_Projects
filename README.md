## Getting Started

Each project is self-contained and can be run independently. To run any project:

1. Navigate to the project folder
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser
3. Start playing or using the application!

No installation, dependencies, or build process required - just pure vanilla JavaScript!

## Technologies Used

All projects are built using:
- **HTML5** - Structure and content
- **CSS3** - Styling and layout
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Interactivity and logic
